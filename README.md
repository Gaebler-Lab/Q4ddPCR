# Q4ddPCR
# This is a repository for a) an example on how to use the R-package for Q4ddPCR analysis (available in https://github.com/buchauer-lab/Q4ddPCR_Analysis/tree/v0.1.0) and b) the code to model a log-linear decay of HIV reservoir size measured by Q4ddPCR and IPDA.

Instructions on how to use the Run File for Q4ddPCR analysis
1) After gating in QX Manager Software, you have to export the cluster data as a csv-file under ‘Export Cluster Data’. Then go to 'Data table' and export the data table of individual wells as an Excel file for the analysis. It has to be an .xlsx file. Tested with QX Manager Software, Standard Edition v2.0. 
2) Download Run File.R and follow the instructions on how to fill the file.
3) Install R-package for Q4ddPCR analysis (available in https://github.com/buchauer-lab/Q4ddPCR_Analysis/tree/v0.1.0).
4) Run the code in the Run File.R
